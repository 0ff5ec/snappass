    <h3>How SnapPass Works</h3>
    <p>SnapPass allows you to share passwords with anybody in a secure, ephemeral way.</p>

    <p>Input a password and set a time to live. The default is one week.</p>

    <p>Once you click the Generate URL button, a unique URL is generated. That unique URL can only be accessed once.</p>

    <p>Share that URL to whomever is the intended recipient of the password. If the URL is never accessed, the URL and the corresponding password will be deleted per the time to live you set. However, if the URL is accessed by your intended recipient, or perhaps an unintended recipient, the URL and the corresponding password will be deleted at that moment.</p>

    <p>If your intended recipient was able to access the URL and retrieve the password, there is a high probability only they saw the password. However, if your intended recipient encountered a 404 when accessing the URL, there is a high probability the URL expired or an unintended recipient accessed the URL through whatever service (email, chat, text) the URL was sent over.</p>
